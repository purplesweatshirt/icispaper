# The augmented theorist

This repository is a clone of AlexeyAB's darknet repo (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) with additional functions for the application of YOLOv4 to figure detection in scientific papers and variable and coefficient detection in graphical representations of Structural Equation Models. 

## Example (on Colab)

[This notebook](https://github.com/purplesweatshirt/icispaper/blob/main/example.ipynb) demonstrates the workflow of our pipeline and is designed to be executed on Colab. Due to the double blind review process, we could not provide a direct link to our Colab Notebook. The two PDFs are used to demonstrate the pipeline.



## Brief overview

The following important files can be found in these directories:
- the detection_utils.py file, which contains all of our wrapper functions
- the cfg files are located in the cfg folder
- the data and names files are located in the data folder
- the pdf files, which are used to demonstrate the workflow
